Cr√©dits : 

 - Thanks to Alexander Tsepkov the creator of RapydScript
 - Charles Law for allowing testing RapydScript online
 - Frederic de Bleser and Tom De Smedt for Nodebox
 - Roger Wang for Node-WebKit
 - The creators of CodeMirror
 
 

PS : I could easily create a packaged apploication (thanks to node-webkit), but 
it seems to be a bad idea to give direct download to  a binary...
But if you really want it, send me a post
