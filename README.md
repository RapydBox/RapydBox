RapydBox
========

Nodebox is the  equivalent (quite) of Processing in Python 

Many Windows users missed the first version of Nodebox, which is only available on Mac.
Tom De Smedt, the creator of Nodebox, has also implemented a partial port of Nodebox in Javasript

RapydBox allows to use this Javascript library from RapydScript (a Python to Javascript translator).

The deployment can be done using Node-Webkit
